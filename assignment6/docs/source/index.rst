Welcome to Assignment6's documentation!
=======================================

For this assignment we are going to use Pandas and Scikit learn to do some machine learning.
We are using different machine learning algorithms and showing the result as images and accuracy score.
In this documentation there is the autogenerated docs from docstring using Sphinx. For step by step instruction
on running the scripts consult README
