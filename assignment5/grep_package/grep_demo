Create a grep-like utility. It should take a filename, along with a regular
expression, and print all lines where there the regex matches on one part of
the line. The regex does not have to match from the start of the line, if
the line is aabbbcccc and the regex is bb, then the line should be printed.
Further, it should be possible to color the matching parts of the lines by using
a --highlight flag.
For IN4110/bonus, it should be possible to take an  number of
regular expressions, and the script should be able to get all of these. The
matching parts should be colored according to what regex they match. How-
ever, it is enough to choose a few colors, and cycle between them, to allow
several regular expressions.
You are encouraged to use code previously written in this assignment (i.e.
the highlighter). Therefore it is recommended that you try to make your code
reusable in 5.1. You should also try to avoid duplicate code. For parsing of the
command line arguments, the argparse module is recommended.
It is not expected that your grep.py script should work exactly as the
UNIX utility. For instance, your implementation is expected to use Pythonâ€™s
regex syntax.
